### 1️⃣ **POST PREVIEW**
**What**: See how your post will look before publishing
**Where**: Click "Preview" button (top-right of form)

```
Form → [Preview Button] → See formatted post in modal
```

### 2️⃣ **SCHEDULED PUBLISHING**
**What**: Schedule posts to publish automatically at a future date/time
**Where**: "Publication" section → Check "Schedule for later"
**When**: Setting up a new post or editing existing one
**Why**: Plan content in advance, publish when it's optimal

```
Publication Section:
  ☐ Publish immediately (default)
  ☐ Schedule for later → Publish Date & Time field
```

**Example Flow**:
1. Write your post
2. Check "Schedule for later"
3. Pick a date/time (e.g., tomorrow at 9 AM)
4. Click "Create Post"
5. ✨ Post goes live automatically at that time

### 3️⃣ **AUTO-SAVE DRAFT RECOVERY**
**What**: Post automatically saves every 60 seconds
**Where**: Top of form (header stats)
**When**: Continuous while you're editing
**Why**: Never lose work again!

```
Header shows:
  • [# words] [# min read] [Auto-saving...] or [✓ Auto-saved]
```

**What happens**:
- Write content → Auto-save runs every minute
- Browser crashes? No problem! Draft is saved
- Return and click "Edit" on the draft
- Continue where you left off

### 4️⃣ **WORD COUNT DISPLAY**
**What**: Real-time word and reading time tracking
**Where**: Form header + each content section
**When**: As you type
**Why**: Know your post length at a glance

```
Header Stats:
  📊 [125 words] [1 min read] 

Content Sections:
  Section 1
  → [50 words]
  
  Section 2

```
